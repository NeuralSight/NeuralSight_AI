NeuralSight AI is an intelligent tool that is capable of detection and highlighting pathologies on chest X-Ray images at runtime.

This repository contains the training code for our project entitled "NeuralSight Imaging AI".

## Abstract

On chest X-rays NeuralSightâ„¢ is capable of Identifying, Labeling and Highlighting over 20 respiratory diseases which include:

## Pipeline
### Model training
#### 1. Data Preparation:
* Image resize (640*640)
* Split data: training, testing, valid dataset(0.9, 0.1)
* Classes: Atelectasis, Infiltration, Emphysema, Mass, Nodule, Pleural Thickening, Effusion, Consolidation etc.


#### 2. Training Confoguration


### Performance
Table classification performance on the validation set.
